## DATA_STRUCTURES.

Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. <br>
The order may be 
* LIFO(Last In First Out) 
  <br> or 
* FILO(First In Last Out).

This feature makes it <b> LIFO </b> data structure. <b> LIFO </b> stands for Last-in-first-out. <br>
Here, the element which is placed (inserted or added) last, is accessed first. <br>
In stack terminology, insertion operation is called <b> PUSH </b> operation and removal operation is called <b> POP </b> operation.

****

Stack operations may involve initializing the stack, using it and then de-initializing it.
Apart from these basic stuffs, a stack is used for the following two primary operations −
    
|||
|---|---|
|push()|Pushing (storing) an element on the stack.|
|pop()|Removing (accessing) an element from the stack.|


To use a stack efficiently, we need to check the status of stack as well. For the same purpose, the following functionality is added to stacks −

|||
|---|---|
|peek()|get the top data element of the stack, without removing it|
|isFull()|check if stack is full|
|isEmpty()|check if stack is empty|
