Abstract Data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of value and a set of operations.

***

* The definition of ADT only mentions what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented.   <br>
* It does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations.  <br>
* It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view.        <br>
* The process of providing only the essentials and hiding the details is known as 'abstraction'.  <br>
