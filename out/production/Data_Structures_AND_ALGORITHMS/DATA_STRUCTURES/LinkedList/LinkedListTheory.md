# Linked Lists

* A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

* A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

*** 

* Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items.
* Each link contains a connection to another link.
* Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array.
* Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.

|                       |                                                               |
|---                    |---                                                            |
|Link                   |Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element|
|Next                   |Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next|
|Prev                   |Each link of a linked list contains a link to the Previous link called Prev. <br> [Only in Circular linked list]|



* <b> DATA_STRUCTURES.LinkedList </b> <br> 
   A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called <b> Head </b>.

#### Types of Linked List

Following are the various types of linked list.

|||
|---|---|
|Simple Linked List    | Item navigation is forward only.
|Doubly Linked List    |Items can be navigated forward and backward.
|Circular Linked List  |Last item contains link of the first element as next and <br> the first element has a link to the last element as previous.

### Basic Operations

#### Following are the basic operations supported by a list.

||||
|---|---|---|
|Insertion |Adds an element at the beginning of the list| 1. InsertAtBeginning <br> 2. InsertAtEnd <br> 3. InsertAtIndex|
|Deletion |Deletes an element at the beginning of the list | 1. DeleteAtBeginning  <br> 2. DeleteAtEnd  <br> 3. DeleteAtIndex|
|Update|Updates node at index i| 1.UpdateAtBeginning  <br> 2.UpdateAtEnd  <br> 3.UpdateAtIndex|
|Display|Displays the complete list||
|Search|Searches an element using the given key||
|IsEmpty|Returs True if List is Empty||


And More ....
