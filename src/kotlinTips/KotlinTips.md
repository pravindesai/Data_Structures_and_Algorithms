### [1. Measure execution time of code snippet](https://github.com/pravindesai/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/blob/master/src/kotlinTips/MeasureExecutionTime.kt)
    Kotlin provides some methods to measure execution time of code. 
### [2. Generic type `<T>`](https://github.com/pravindesai/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/blob/master/src/kotlinTips/GenericClass.kt)
#### Using Generics, it is possible to create classes that work with different data types. An entity such as class, interface, or method that operates on a parameterized type is a generic entity.

* Advantages of generic â€“
    * <b>Type casting is evitable</b>- No need to typecast the object.
    * <b>Type safety</b>- Generic allows only single type of object at a time.
    * <b>Compile time safety</b>- Generics code is checked at compile time for the parameterized type so that it avoids run time error.
